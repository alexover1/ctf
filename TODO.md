# TODO List

- Give sheep that have not been on a player's head or in a goal in 30 seconds glowing, so they don't get lost
- Make sheep not in a goal also lose their color
- Countdown timer for start game (using /schedule and a score for how many seconds)

## Class Tweaks

- Spearthrower needs item descriptions
- Maybe replace the Ranger's sword with a crossbow?

## Map Tweaks

- "Join Raiders" guy should be holding a sword and holding it up like "YAAAAAAAAAH!"
- "Join Ravagers" guy should have a shield and an axe
- Credits room / other secret room
- Add some NPCs to the Castle map

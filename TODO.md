# TODO List

- Countdown timer at the end of the game so players get a chance to "breathe"
  and take in the fact that they just won / lost
- Sheep can get stuck in blocks

## Map Tweaks

- "Join Raiders" guy should be holding a sword and holding it up like "YAAAAAAAAAH!"
- "Join Ravagers" guy should have a shield and an axe
- Credits room / other secret room
- Add some NPCs to the Castle map

# TODO List

- Give sheep that have not been on a player's head or in a goal in 30 seconds glowing, so they don't get lost
- Make sheep not in a goal also lose their color
- Countdown timer for start game (using /schedule and a score for how many seconds)
- Actionbar should show how many sheep are on your head
- Gamerule seeFriendlyInvis?
- Clear potion effects when returning to lobby

## Class Tweaks

- Archer needs more arrows, and should only have a wooden sword!
- Beast Tamer should possibly have a stronger weapon(?), but the wolves should last twice as long
- Spearthrower needs item descriptions
- Getting hit as rogue needs to cancel invis and the duration should be NERFED (20 or 30 seconds, MAX)

## Map Tweaks

- "Join Raiders" guy should be holding a sword and holding it up like "YAAAAAAAAAH!"
- "Join Ravagers" guy should have a shield and an axe
- Credits room / other secret room
- Make sure to set the "Spectate" guy to use the function for leaving your team
